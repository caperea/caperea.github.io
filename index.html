    <h2>3. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect the data stored and processed, to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our app may contain links to third-party websites or services, which have privacy practices independent from us. Therefore, we bear no responsibility for the content or privacy policies of these links. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
